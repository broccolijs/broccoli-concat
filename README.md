Broccoli concatenator that generates & propagates sourcemaps
-------------------------------------------------

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/bpxeh0we50eod6xw/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/embercli/broccoli-sourcemap-concat/branch/master)

This filter is designed to be fast & good enough. It can generates
source maps substantially faster than you'll get via
mozilla/source-map, because it's special-cased for straight
line-to-line contenation.

It discovers input sourcemaps in relative URLs, including data URIs.


### Usage

```js
var node = concat(node);
```

#### Advanced Usage

```js
var node = concat(node, {
  outputFile: '/output.js',
  header: ";(function() {",
  headerFiles: ['loader.js'],
  inputFiles: ['**/*'],
  footerFiles: ['auto-start.js'],
  footer: "}());",
  sourceMapConfig: { enabled: true },
  allowNone: false | true // defaults to false, and will error if trying to concat but no files are found.
});
```

The structure of `output.js` will be as follows:

```
// - header
// - ordered content of the files in headerFiles
// - un-ordered content of files matched by inputFiles, but not in headerFiles or footerFiles
// - ordered content of the files in footerFiles
// - footer
```

##### Ordering of inputFiles

Sevaral orderings may be appropriate for inputFiles. Some are slightly more
expensive then others, and others are specific to certain scenarios.

By default files matched within `inputFiles` will sorted lexicographically.
This is to ensure that between multiple concats, the output remain stable and
also as files are added and removed, that the output file change in predictable
(diff friendly) ways.

A common alternative is to sort these files based on the matcher precedent.

Given:

```
inputFiles: ['foo/*.global.css', 'foo/*.overides.css']
```

One may want, want all global css files to proceed overide css files, while
within each glob preserving lexicographical order

To accomplish this, broccoli-concat provides an alternative comparator.

```js
var concat = require('broccoli-concat');
var matchComparator = require('broccoli-concat/comparators/match');

concat(input, {
  outputFile: 'styles.css',
  inputFiles: ['foo/*.global.css', 'foo/*.overides.css'],
  inputFilesComparator: matchComparator
})
```

If an alternative ordering strategy is required, the signature of inputFilesComparator is:

* firstFile: {String} fileName
* secondFile: {String} fileName
* matchers: {Array} matching the inputFiles argument, but where each entry has been converted into a minimatch instance

For an example see: [comparators/match](comparators/match)

#### Debug Usage

*note: this is intended for debugging purposes only, and will most likely negatively affect your build performace is left enabled*

Setting the environment variable `CONCAT_STATS=true` will result a summary of
each concatention being output to `process.cwd() + 'concat-stats-for/*.json'`

Each file within that directory represents a different contenation, and will contain:

* outputFile – the output file that was created
* sizes – a summary of each input file, and the associated pre-minified pre-gziped byte size.

##### Example:

concat-stats-for/<id>-file.json
```json
{
  "outputFile": "path/to/output/File",
  "sizes": {
    "a.js": 5,
    "b.js": 10,
  }
}
```

other files:

* concat-stats-for/<id>-file/a.js
* concat-stats-for/<id>-file/b.js
